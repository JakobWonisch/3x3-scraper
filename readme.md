# 3x3 Scraper

This is a series of python scripts for scraping fiba3x3 play-by-play data of World Tour games.

Basic scraped data (list of events and games) can be found in the [output](/output) directory.
Full scraped data ([playbyplay + stats](https://hierwonisch.at/downloads/3x3scraper/playbyplay_and_stats.json), [playbyplay only](https://hierwonisch.at/downloads/3x3scraper/playbyplay.json) and [stats only](https://hierwonisch.at/downloads/3x3scraper/stats.json)) can be downloaded by clicking on the links, since they are too large for GitHub.
